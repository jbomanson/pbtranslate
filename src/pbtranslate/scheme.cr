# This module contains schemes for generating networks.
#
# Each scheme represents some class of networks parametrized by some property.
# These networks can generally be instantiated via `#network` or `#network?`
# methods of a scheme.
# These two kinds of network generation methods will raise and return nil
# on errors, respectively.
